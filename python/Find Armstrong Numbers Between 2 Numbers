#Armstrong Number=number of n digits which are equal to sum of nth power of its digits
#Example=suppose we need to find 153 is armstrong number or not.
#so for this we need to count number of digits that are 3 
#then as number of digits are 3 we need to find the value of
#1 to the power 3,5 to the power 3 and 3 to the power 3
#and add all three values that are 1+125+27 = 153
#as the number first taken is same after this procedure that means 153 is a armstrong number
